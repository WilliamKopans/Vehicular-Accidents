# Temporal Analysis of Car Accident Data

# Introduction:

The goal of this analysis is to use temporal analysis techniques to better understand the root causes of traffic accidents, inform policy decisions, and educate drivers to reduce the risk of injury or death. Driving is one of the most dangerous activities that we participate in on a daily basis. Each year, `r library(dplyr); format(round(nrow(Master_Dataframe %>% filter(Injury_Severity_Basic == "Fatal")) / (max(Master_Dataframe$Accident_year)-min(Master_Dataframe$Accident_year)), digits = -2), scientific = FALSE, big.mark=",")` people die from car accidents. On a personal level, there are a lot of factors outside of your control when on the road, but one that you often can control is when you drive. Should you drive at night or wait until noon the next day? Should you drive during the holidays (in particular those that involve all-night drinking)? We should understand the root causes of traffic accidents to educate our divers, improve road infrastructure, and inform policy decisions. Using temporal analysis techniques focused on the date and time of day, we can glean insights into accident patterns and better inform people who want to change their habits to reduce their risk of getting injured or killed. While driving will always be inherently dangerous, we can take measures to minimize that risk by using data-driven insights.

# Methods:

Data was collected from the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration between `r min(Master_Dataframe$Accident_year)` and `r max(Master_Dataframe$Accident_year)`. The dataset has `r format(nrow(Master_Dataframe), big.mark=",")` accidents recorded and gives information on factors such as the date/time, if the participant was intoxicated, the injury severity, and the location. Prior to conducting any analysis, the dataset underwent a series of data cleaning and manipulation steps. Column names were modified to make them more human-readable, and data values were converted from numeric representations to text. These improved readability and consistency. Next, the dataset was cleaned and transformed using dplyr. Additional modifications included adding columns such as those which designate what region the accident took place or if an accident happened during the day or at night.

The data manipulation and cleaning steps were performed using R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31) on a MacBook Pro running macOS Monterey (12.4). All data manipulation and cleaning steps are documented in a script file for reproducibility purposes and can be viewed through dropdown "code" menus throughout the document.

# Results:

### Graph 1: Number of Accidents by Month and Injury Severity

The majority of accidents occur in July with the fewest in February. Surprisingly, there is not as comensorate a drop in the number of fatalities in February as compared with July as one may expect based on the total number of accidents being higher. Although lower during February, the number of fatalities remains fairly constant across the year at around `r Master_Dataframe %>% filter(Injury_Severity_Basic == "Fatal") %>%  group_by(Accident_month) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% summarize(mean_count = mean(count)) %>% pull(mean_count) %>% round(digits = -3) %>% format(big.mark = ",")` deaths. There is a peak of suspected major and minor injuries in July, which is not reflected among the confirmed injuries. Fatal injuries, for instance, are elevated all summer. The number of accidents that do not result in any injury remains fairly steady across all months around `r Master_Dataframe %>% filter(Injury_severity == "No Apparent Injury") %>%  group_by(Accident_month) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% summarize(mean_count = mean(count)) %>% pull(mean_count) %>% round(digits = -3) %>% format(big.mark = ",")` incidents. 

```{r Graph 1: Number of Accidents by Month and Injury Severity}
ggplot(Master_Dataframe %>% filter(!is.na(Injury_severity)), aes(x = Month_Name, fill = Injury_severity)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of accidents", title = "Number of Accidents by Month and Injury Severity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightblue", "orange", "mediumpurple1", "red1", "darkred", "tan1", "indianred3"))+
  theme_minimal()
```



### Graph 2: Number of Accidents per Month

We can see that the south accounts for the majority of accidents and the northeast region accounts for the least. When adjusting the scales to not be uniform we can see a normal distribution of accidents in the midwest, northeast, and west regions centered around August. The south remains at a similar level across months.

```{r Graph 2: Number of Accidents per Month}
APM <- ggplot(Master_Dataframe %>% filter(!is.na(Datetime)), aes(x = month(Datetime, label = TRUE))) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("Number of Accidents per Month") + 
  facet_wrap( ~ region) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "Months", y = "Count")
APMRel <- ggplot(Master_Dataframe %>% filter(!is.na(Datetime)), aes(x = month(Datetime, label = TRUE))) +
   geom_bar() +
   ggtitle("Number of Accidents per Month") + 
   facet_wrap( ~ region, scales = "free_y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "Months", y = "Count")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(APM, APMRel, ncol = 2)
rm("APM","APMRel")
```


### Graph 3: Analyzing the Relationship Between Time and Accidents Across Different Months 
Note: February 29th removed to account for leap years 

When graphing the number of accidents every day over the year, we can see that New Years and July 4th are dangerous times to be on the road. In particular, after 4pm on July 4th and just after midnight on January 1st are especially dangerous. In general, mornings are reasonably safe and accidents pick up around 9:00 am. Accidents then become much more frequent after 4:00 pm as people leave from work and kids get out of school.



```{r Graph 3: Analyzing the Relationship Between Time and Accidents Across Different Months, message=FALSE}
accidents_per_day <- Master_Dataframe %>%
mutate(DoY = yday(Datetime), Month = month(Datetime), Day = day(Datetime), Hour = hour(Datetime)) %>%
group_by(Month, Day, Hour) %>%
summarize(count = n()) %>%
ungroup()

ggplot(subset(accidents_per_day, !(Month == 2 & Day == 29)), aes(x = Day, y = Hour, fill = count - mean(count))) +
  geom_tile(width = 0.5) +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "dodgerblue4", mid = "white", high = "indianred3", midpoint = 0) +
  facet_wrap(~ month(Month, label = TRUE)) +
  labs(x = "Day", y = "Time", fill = "Accidents", title = "Analyzing the Relationship Between Time and Accidents Across Different Months")+

# Demographic Analysis Over The Day 

## Graph 4: Distribution of Age of Persons Involved in Accidents {.tabset}

Across the whole year, the majority of accidents occur at night (as defined by 8:00 pm until midnight) and the fewest occur during the evening (as defined by 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm). It is important to note that the evening window is also the smallest in terms of number of hours it emcompasses which distorts accident count as periods are not uniformly long and are arbitrary. Starting in the evening, there are fewer people over the age of 60 getting in accidents which is likely a result of that group not being on the road as much as young and middle aged people.

We can see that, in general, men are involved in more accidents across the board than women. This is especially apparent between the ages of 16 (when people generally get their drivers licences) and 75. Before the age of 16 both genders are involved in similar numbers of accidents as the individuals identified as not driving and are simply passengers.

Although the percent of accidents where men are involved is elevated relative to female for the vast majority of ages, we can see that during the night/twilight hours the proportion of men to women increases among older people. The period of time when male and female are most balanced is during the mid-day period.

## Accidents Caused By Intoxication By Gender Over The Day {.tabset}

We can see that the majority of accidents involving alcohol occur late at night (midnight to 5:00 am) which is followed by the mid-day (noon to 5 pm) and nighttime (8:00 pm to midnight) periods. 

In the morning there are very few accidents involving alcohol. There is a noticable spike in accidents among 24 year old men getting into accidents in the morning, but more than 3/4 of the other accidents are from sober drivers. 

During the middle of the day there is a less noticable peak around 25 and instead men between 25 and 60 are getting into accidents from alcohol. It is important to note again that this is of a very small number of accidents involving alcohol at this time.

Progressing from the evening period through the late night period we can see a signficant uptick in accidents, in particular those involving alcohol. Men between the ages of 20 and 60 remain the most at risk of getting into an accident while intoxicated during these periods. Late at night, when the majority of accidents take place, we can see that more than half of all accidents are caused by drunk men. 

Across the board, women are generally involved in very few accidents involving alcohol, but at night and very late into the night there is a decent sized segment of the female population getting into accidents due to alcohol. Most of these are from female drivers between the ages of 20 and 60, with a spike around 26.

## Graph 5: Relationship between Hour of Day and Age of Persons Involved in Accidents, Colored by Injury Severity and Faceted by Sex 

We can see that both non-fatal and fatal accidents tend to involve younger individuals over the course of the day. As such, the spread decreases throughout the day and especially small late at night. The spread of age is largest during the midday period. At night and during the late night periods, the median is near the 25th percentile for age which indicates that the majority of the data points are clustered towards the lower end of the distribution, with relatively few extreme values towards the upper end of the age distribution.

Across all times, the median age is higher for fatal accidents than non-fatal accidents. This makes sense since older individuals may have more health complications and more frail bodies overall. 

```{r Graph 11: Relationship between Hour of Day and Age of Persons Involved in Accidents, Colored by Injury Severity and Faceted by Sex}

```


## Boxplot of Age by Injury Severity Over Time {.tabset}
Over the course of the day more of the accidents involve younger individuals. For instance, the age of accidents which do not reuslt in an injury decreases by about a decade from the morning to late in the night.

Generally, the spread of age is largest during the mid-day period as people of all ages are awake. The spread narrows significantly as we enter the late night where most accidents are involve younger individuals (usually around the age of 25). One notable exception to this are individuals who died prior to the crash which remains to be an older demographic with a larger spread throughout the day.

## Graph 6: Distribution of Age by Sex Involved in Accidents

During the morning, midday, and the evening the distribution of men and women is almost identical, with medians that are almost equal around 35 years old and a large number of accidents involving those around the age of 25 years old. Starting in the evening and continuing through the late night period we can see the median age lower to 25 years old, a decade drop from earlier in the day. We can also see a much more pronounced peak of accidents amoung young individuals around the age of 17 (presumably those who are new to driving, in partiuclar driving at night). Accordingly, the spread of ages decreases throughout the day. Throughout all time periods, men and women are mostly on par with each other in terms of the distribution of accidents amoung their groups.

# Accident Characteristics Over Time

### Graph 7: Number of Accidents by Vehicle Body Type and Injury Severity

We can see that across all time periods automobiles are involved in the most accidents. This is unsurprising since the majority of vehicles on the road are automobiles. Most of the serious/fatal injuries of those in automobiles take place during the midday period when nearly 15,000 accidents occur in which there is a serious or fatal injury. During the evening there are generally far fewer serious or fatal accidents which is commensorate with the generally fewer number of accidents at that time.

Trucks are involved in a significant number of accidents during the morning and at midday, but many of them do not result in any injury. Vans and minivans also get into accidents in the mornig and midday, but many more of those result in more injuries or deaths than with trucks (as a proportion of accidents vans are involved in).

### Graph 8: Heatmap of Accidents by Hour and Day of the Week

We can see that very few accidents occur during the week before 5:00 am. There is a slight uptick in the number of accidents around 8:00 am as people commute to work, but this subsides until 3:00 pm when accidents pick up and continue to be high through 6:00 pm. Of the weekdays, Friday evenings and nights are the most dangerous, likely caused by people eager to get home for the weekend and those who decide to party later into the night. The elevated number of accidents on Friday continue into Saturday until 4:00am.

On the weekends it is generally pretty safe to drive between 4:00am and 11:00 am. After noon accidents tend to pick up. Similar to Friday nights, Saturday nights are periods when many accidents take place and this continues through Sunday at 4:00 am. Sundays have a large number of accidents around 6:00 pm, but there are far fewer accidents late at night than on Fridays or Saturdays, presumably because people are getting ready for the work week.

### Teenage Accidents Involving Alcohol By Day and Region

Earlier, we identified that the majority of accidents occur in the south. When looking at teenage drivers, the south remains to be a region where a lot of accidents take place. It is notable to point out that the delta between number of accidents on weekdays and weekends is very significant for southern states which is not as aparent (although still the case) in the other regions. The northeast remains a region with very few accidents.

When we zoom in on which regions have the most accidents among teenagers under the influence, we can see that the south actually has fewer drunk teenage drivers relative to the other regions. The northeast and western states have the most teenage drivers getting into accidents that involve alcohol. 

The weekends are a particularly risky time for teenage drivers to drive under the influence which is unsurprising since they are not in school. Generally, there are nearly double the number of accidents involving alcohol than those that don't of teens on weekends than on weekdays. Surprisingly, there is a lack of accidents involving alcohol among teens on Friday nights. Across all regions there is very little incrase in the numbers of accidents teens get into while drunk on Fridays as compared to other weekdays.

### Graph 9: Seasonal Analysis
Below we will begin an exploration of the trends in the number of accidents.

```{r Seasonal Analysis 1}
accidents_per_day <- Master_Dataframe %>%
  group_by(Date) %>%
  summarise(per_day = n())


# Plot 1: Accidents per Day with Linear Regression
ggplot(accidents_per_day, aes(x = Date, y = per_day)) + geom_line() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "red") +
  ggtitle("Accidents per Day with Linear Regression")

# Generate a model object from the regression fit
M1 <- lm(per_day ~ as.numeric(Date), accidents_per_day) 
accidents_per_day$res1 <- M1$residuals

# Plot 2: Residuals from Linear Regression
ggplot(accidents_per_day, aes(x = Date, y = res1)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  ggtitle("Residuals from Linear Regression")+
  stat_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE)
```
There is a significant curve that has critical points around 2005 and 2012 with a linear regression fit suggesting that the linear model does not accurately reflect the dataset. Despite our attempt to control for the trend in the data, our simple linear model does not capture the trend well.

```{r Seasonal Analysis 2}
# Plot 3: Accidents per Day with Quadratic Regression
ggplot(accidents_per_day, aes(x = Date, y = per_day)) + geom_line() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x + I(x^2), 
              se = FALSE, col = "red") +
  ggtitle("Accidents per Day with Quadratic Regression")

M2 <- lm(per_day ~ as.numeric(Date) + I(as.numeric(Date)^2), data = accidents_per_day)
accidents_per_day$res2 <- M2$residuals

# Plot 4: Residuals from Quadratic Regression
ggplot(accidents_per_day , aes(x = Date, y = res2)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  stat_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Residuals from Quadratic Regression")
```
Although an improvement over the first order polynomial model, there remains a slight curve that has critical points around 2005 and 2011 with a quadratic regression fit. This indicates that the trend is not linear and instead follows a polynomal trajectory.  


```{r Seasonal Analysis 3}
# Plot 5: Accidents per Day with Cubic Regression
ggplot(accidents_per_day, aes(x = Date, y = per_day)) + geom_line() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x + I(x^2) + I(x^3), 
              se = FALSE, col = "red") +
  ggtitle("Accidents per Day with Cubic Regression")

M2 <- lm(per_day ~ as.numeric(Date) + I(as.numeric(Date)^2) + I(as.numeric(Date)^3), data = accidents_per_day)

accidents_per_day$res2 <- M2$residuals

# Plot 6: Residuals from Cubic Regression
ggplot(accidents_per_day , aes(x = Date, y = res2)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  stat_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Residuals from Cubic Regression")
```
The residuals still retains a "w" shape with a cubic regression fit. This can hamper our analysis of the oscillatory patterns in the data. We can try a non-parametric fit and see if it can capture the 2003 to 2010 hump. That being said, it is reasonably close to a straight line and could be used as a reasonable model if future investigation wishes to use a parametric fit.

```{r Seasonal Analysis 4}
# Plot 7: Accidents per Day with LOESS Smoothing
ggplot(accidents_per_day, aes(x = Date, y = per_day)) + geom_line() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "loess", span = 1/4, se = FALSE, col = "red") +
  ggtitle("Accidents per Day with LOESS Smoothing")

lo <- loess(per_day ~ as.numeric(Date), accidents_per_day, span=1/4)
accidents_per_day$res3 <- lo$residuals

# Plot 9: Residuals from LOESS Smoothing
ggplot(accidents_per_day,  aes(x = Date, y = res3)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  stat_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, span = 0.2) +
ggtitle("Residuals from LOESS Smoothing")
```
The non-parametric fit is a significant improvement compard to the linear or polynomial fits (as the loess is almost a straight line), suggesting the number of accidents has some non-linear and/or non-monotonic components. 

``` {r Exploring seasonality 1}
accidents_per_day$MonthTwo <- month(accidents_per_day$Date, label=TRUE) 

ggplot(accidents_per_day, aes(x = MonthTwo, y = res3)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(y = "Loess Residual")
```
We can see that the plot follows a yearly oscillation cycle which peaks during the summer time and is the lowest during the winter. Since driving conditions are highly regionional, it is difficult to glean to what extent the model is accurately acounting for changes in driving conditions or habits. Therefore, it is important to understand the regional factors before moving forward.

#### Regional Analysis of first order residuals
``` {r Added to explore seasonality further}
Master_DataframePerDay <- Master_Dataframe %>%
  group_by(region, Month_Name, Date) %>%
  summarize(per_day = n(), .groups = 'drop')

lo2 <- loess(per_day ~ as.numeric(Date), Master_DataframePerDay, span = 1/4)

Master_DataframePerDay$res3 <- lo2$residuals

ggplot(Master_DataframePerDay, aes(x = factor(Month_Name), y = res3)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ region) +
  labs(title = "Box Plots of Residuals by Month and Region",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()

```

There exist large discrepencies between how well the model fits each region. The western states fit the national model best, but other regions such as the south are not modeled well. We can also make out a noticable oscilation in the midwest which peaks near zero in August (meaning that the model fits the data well during that period and falls off on either end). 

In the south the observed values are far greater than the predicted values based on the model. This is balanced out by the northeast, west, and to a lesser extent midwest regions which are understimated by the model.

With these discrepencies in mind, we will continue our exploration without the seasonal component by subtracting the median residual to see if another pattern emerges. 

``` {r Exploring seasonality 2}
d3 <- accidents_per_day %>% 
  group_by(month(Date)) %>%
  mutate(Resid.lev = res3 - median(res3)) 

ggplot(d3, aes(x = MonthTwo, y = Resid.lev)) + geom_boxplot()  + labs(x = "Month")
```

The spreads among months are generally consistant across months with slightly larger spreads in May, July, and September. We can also identify that the data in September ius skewed towards lower values than predicted.

``` {r Exploring seasonality 3}

d3$YearTwo <- year(accidents_per_day$Date) 

ggplot(d3, aes(x = YearTwo, y = Resid.lev)) + geom_point(col = "grey", cex = .6)  + 
     stat_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm") + facet_wrap(~ MonthTwo, nrow = 1) +
     theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1.6,  size = 7)) + labs(x = "Year")
```

We can see that the residuals generally fit the data well from September until May, but during the summer there has been a decline in data values as compared to predicted values over time. This could suggest a gradual offset in the periodicy of the two decades of data. We will fit a loess model to see if the trends for each month are monotonic by adopting a robust loess which controls for possible outliers in the data.

``` {r Exploring seasonality 4}

ggplot(d3, aes(x = YearTwo, y = Resid.lev)) + geom_point(col = "grey", cex = .6)  + 
     stat_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, 
                 method.args = list(family = "symmetric")) + 
     facet_wrap(~ MonthTwo, nrow = 1) +
     theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust = 1.5, vjust = 1.6,  size = 7))+ labs(x = "Year")

```
The trends do not appear to be monotonic (except for May, October, and to a lesser extent September) which suggests that the cyclical nature of accidents occuring is not systemic. 


## Moving Window Analysis:
Across all regions we can see that the number of accidents per day (mean in window) has been decreacing over the past two decades and has recently seen an uptick. The spread of mean values per window had a lot of variation in the late 20th century and became much more consistant around 2004 which has remained reasonably consistant with some windows being less uniform than in the 2004-2008 period. The recent uptick is notable, but remains signficantly lower than two decades ago.

``` {r Moving Window Statistics, message=FALSE}

SingleWindow <- function(statistic, data, colname = NULL) {
  if (!is.data.frame(data)) {
    stop("The input data must be a dataframe.")

We can see that the northeastern states have consistently been safer than the other regions and that the western states have been the greatest risk over the past twenty years. The south saw a noticeable decrease in accidents between 1996 and 2011 which the other regions echoed but to a lesser extent. The midwest has not seen as significant an uptick recently as compared to the other regions and has nearly flatlined over the past six years.

# Look into modeling and looking for outliers like I did on the group HW

# I should find what state is most dangerous for July 4th and New Years, Also view just Feb to see what is going on with the line

# What leads to fatal accidents? (Subset data or mutate a column identifying fatal and facet)

# Maybe look at deaths of children and where the collisions take place, like are sideswipes more dangerous cause theyre in the back seat?
